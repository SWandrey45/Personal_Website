    <h2>You don't need a great camera to take great photos</h2>
    <p>In order to start taking photos, you don't need a camera that is the most technologically advanced model on the market! Getting started with photography means using something that takes photos!</p>

                <td>Use: Your Phone Camera</td>

                <td>Film cameras require a lot of work and having access to a darkroom. You also have to learn about the different chemicals used to develop film.</td>

    <h3>Patience is key</h3>
    <p>Sometimes the best photos you take will happen at the right place and time. Sit on a bench for ten minutes and absorb your surroundings! You never know who will pass by or what sort of photo they will create for you. For example, I was standing on the edge of a pond when a dog ran by and scared a flock of pidgeons. This made the flock take flight all around me and I was able to take this photograph:</p>
    <div class="photo">
        <img src="./images/birds.jpg" alt="birds" width="300" height="400">
    </div>
    <p> Also, taking a video can help because you can take stills from the film that work as photographs! Never miss an opportunity for a great shot again. For example take this video of a dog. If I pause it at the right time, I can get some very impressive shots!</p>
    <div class="photo">
        <!--HTML video element taken from https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_video.asp-->
        <video width="500" height="700" controls>
            <source src="./images/Dog%20video.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
    </div>
    <p>As you can see below, the video can be broken up into multiple shots of the dog in action!</p>
    <div class="photo">
        <img src="./images/dogpond1.jpg" alt="dog1" width="300" height="400">
        <img src="./images/DogPond2.jpg" alt="dog2" width="300" height="400">
